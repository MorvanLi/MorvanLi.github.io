My name is **Bo Li** (李波). I am currently a PhD student in [School of Computer Science  and Technology](http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/liukeen/4) and co-supervised by [A.P Lingling Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhanglling).

My research lies at **spiking neural network** , **spiking neural P systems**  and **image fusion**.

I'm open to any kinds of collaboration. Please feel free to contact me directly through email.
